# 🍅 Tomato Plant Stages Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **automating the identification of tomato plant growth stages** using **deep learning models**. It classifies tomato plants into two stages:
1. **Stage 1: Early Vegetative**
2. **Stage 2: Flowering Initiation**

Several deep learning architectures were tested, including:
- **Custom CNN**
- **ResNet50**
- **VGG16**
- **InceptionV3**
- **EfficientNetB0**
- **MobileNetV2**
- **YOLOv3**

The best-performing models were **ResNet50** and **EfficientNetB0**, achieving high accuracy.
